This repository demonstrates an uncommon code error in Kotlin related to the behavior of `removeIf` and `removeAll` functions when used with different collection types (MutableList, MutableSet, MutableMap).  The `bug.kt` file shows the unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.kt` offers a better approach.  This showcases a subtle nuance that can lead to bugs if not carefully considered.
